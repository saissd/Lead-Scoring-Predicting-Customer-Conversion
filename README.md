# Lead-Scoring-Predicting-Customer-Conversion


📌 Project Overview
This project builds a lead scoring model to predict whether a potential customer will purchase a product or service. The model uses demographic, behavioral, and engagement data to classify leads as high-value (likely to convert) or low-value (unlikely to convert).

🎯 Objective
Develop a machine learning model to assess the probability of lead conversion.
Identify key features that impact customer decisions.
Optimize the lead prioritization process to improve business decision-making.
📂 Dataset Overview
This project uses a synthetic dataset mimicking real-world lead scoring data. It includes:
🔹 Demographics: Age, Gender, Income, Occupation
🔹 Behavioral Data: Website visits, Time on site, Email interactions, Ad clicks
🔹 Engagement Metrics: Call response, Past purchases, Interest score
🔹 Target Variable: Converted (1 = Purchased, 0 = Not Purchased)

📌 Sample Data:

📊 Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	AUC-ROC
Logistic Regression	78.5%	74.2%	69.8%	0.81
Random Forest	85.3%	81.4%	76.5%	0.89
XGBoost	87.1%	83.7%	78.9%	0.91
🔹 XGBoost performed best with 87.1% accuracy and a 0.91 AUC-ROC score.
🔹 Feature Importance Analysis revealed that Interest Score, Website Visits, and Ad Clicks were the top predictors of conversion.

📌 Key Insights
✅ Customers with higher website engagement (visits & time on site) are more likely to convert.
✅ Ad Clicks & Interest Score significantly influence purchase decisions.
✅ Machine learning can effectively rank leads based on their likelihood of conversion.
